## What is Workflow Builder?

Workflow Builder is an open-source, frontend-only SDK for building and embedding visual workflow editors into your application.

It provides a ready-made workflow editor UI - including canvas, nodes, edges, layout and configuration panels - so you don’t have to build workflow UX from scratch.

Workflow Builder focuses exclusively on the **frontend editor layer**.  
Execution, orchestration, and business logic remain fully under your control.

## What Workflow Builder is NOT

Workflow Builder does **not**:

- execute workflows
- provide scheduling or orchestration
- include backend logic or integrations
- act as an iPaaS or automation platform

The SDK outputs workflow definitions (JSON) that are meant to be executed by **your own backend**.

## Key features

- Visual workflow editor (nodes, edges, layout, validation)
- Configurable and extensible node system
- Schema-driven properties panels
- Workflow serialization to JSON
- Plugin-first architecture
- Back-end agnostic
- Designed for embedding into SaaS products
- Theming and white-label support
- Design System Kit

## Typical use cases

Workflow Builder is commonly used to:

- embed workflow editors into B2B SaaS products
- build visual rule engines and configuration tools
- design AI agent and automation workflow platforms
- serve as a foundation for workflow-driven products and standalone apps
